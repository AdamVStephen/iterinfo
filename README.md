# ITER Info

The ITER fusion project makes certain information available in the public domain.

As a fusion researcher, this repo includes my personal notes and a couple of scripts for aggregating this information when I move to a new development machine.  It is also handy when onboarding new colleagues.   Share and enjoy.

With thanks to all of my colleagues within the ITER project, and to the project leadership for helping to advance our field by sharing.
